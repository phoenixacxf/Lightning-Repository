# Lightning-Repository
This is a repository for things I will be doing in my day to day life. 

## Note on Attributions
If this repository is made public, you may use the code and programs within it however you wish. When used commercially, I do request that any code taken from this repository is attributed to me in some way (whether that be as a comment or something else). Attributions to me should refer to this repository as the Lightning-Repository, and should include the names of whatever file the code borrowed is from along with the most recent push date for that file. I should be referred to as "Phoenix Lightning" in any attributions. If you are modifying my code in any way, while I prefer that you do, you do not need to attribute me. My code is free for reference, however I doubt you'd want to use it as such.

For any personal use, use my code however you like with no attribution necessary.

This repository *is* licensed with the MIT license. However, I will not be strictly enforcing this license. For full clarity of what is and isn't allowed:
1. You must attribute me on commercial works that use full unmodified blocks of my code or full files of my code.
2. You do not need to attribute me on modified blocks of code or full code files, however, I prefer that you do.
3. You do not need to attribute me on anything used for personal use. However, if anything personal *does* become commercial, I request that you do attribute me as a courtesy, not as a necessity.

Please note, I will not be strictly enforcing the MIT license or these rules. It's an honor's system. I won't be searching code to see if it uses my code. I don't have a legal team that will monitor for my code. I am just an independent person who would prefer my work is attributed to me. 

Attributions to me should look something like the following example:
Multi-Line:
```bash
# borrowed-script.sh
# Author: Phoenix Lightning
# Version Date: YYYY-MM-DD OR MM-DD-YYYY
# License: Copyright (c) 2026 Phoenix Lightning
# Link: https://github.com/phoenixacxf/Lightning-Repository/blob/main/borrowed-script.sh
```
Single Line:
```bash
# From [Lightning-Repository/script.sh](https://github.com/phoenixacxf/Lightning-Repository/blob/main/borrowed-script.sh) by Phoenix Lightning (YYYY-DD-MM)
```

They don't need to look perfectly as shown above. These are just examples.

With this, I would like to note that I will be attributing all lines or sections of code that I did borrowed as per the license of the code and the requests of the individual who created said code. If you see anything in my code that looks like it might be yours, but it isn't credited, please let me know.

Another note on this: I don't like Artificial Intelligence. As a rule, I try to avoid using it at all costs. I have found ethical issues in using it myself due to the consumption of water and the usage of people's data and works without permission. However, I do use Claude AI Sonnet 4.5 by anthropic a lot of the time for a few reasons:
1. Claude AI has a lower amount of water usage when compared to other AIs.
2. Training Data used with Claude AI is typically more ethical from my understanding.
3. Claude AI is the preferred AI software within legal fields. Since my mom is a lawyer, I have access to the paid version of Claude. Along with this, I love legal stuff, so it is very possible that in the future I will use Claude for legal usage in my career.

Any time I use Artificial Intelligence, it will be attributed as well in my comments. However its usage will be limited. There will be comments both at the start and end of the AI/AI Assisted script, shown like so:
Before the AI script:
```bash
# The following script was written partially or completely by AI and was made with the assistance of Claude Sonnet 4.5 on YYYY-MM-DD with the following prompt:
# [Insert Prompt Here]
```
After the AI script:
```bash
# End of AI Assisted code. Code was made with the assistance of Claude Sonnet 4.5 by Anthropic.
```

I would really rather my work is not used to train AI, but I know I can't stop that from happening, so really it's just a request.
